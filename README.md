# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section

![Design preview for the Four card feature section coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge was to build the four card feature section and so it looked as close to the design as possible for mobile and desktop screen sizes.

## File locations

The designs images, located inside the `/design` folder, are in JPG static format. Best judgment was used for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

The assets are located in the `/images` folder. The assets were already optimized.

The `style-guide.md` file, containing information such as color palette and fonts, is located in the root folder.

## Building the project

1. Created a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Configured repo to publish code to GitHub Pages.
3. Reviewed design files.
4. Structured content with HTML based on desktop design.
5. Started CSS with general styling of color variables and fonts.
6. Added styles for mobile design then included media queries for larger screen sizes.

### What I learned

Had to review/relearn basic Grid concepts for fluid changes to grid layout with changing screen sizes, and for grid styling to reorder and position specific grid items.
